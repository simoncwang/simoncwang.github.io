# My Personal Webpage!

Check it out here! --> [**üåê My Website**](https://simoncwang.github.io/)

## Contents

My webpage contains basic information about my **experience, research interests, coursework, and other ways to find out more about me!** It also serves as a portfolio of my various **research, course, and personal projects** including articles describing their motivation and development. 

## Implementation

I created this webpage from scratch in html, javascript, and css! I used the following libraries and toolkits:

* [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS and Javascript framework used via CDN with jsDelivr
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - icon library and toolkit

For more details, please check out my blog post about the process of creating this website as well as the challenges I faced! _(coming soon)_

## WIP (works in progress)

* **Personal Blog** (can find the beginnings under the blog tab in the top navbar!)
  * The direction of this blog has still not being finalized, but in general I intend to have it be a representation of things I am interested in or excited about in general!
  * Additionally, I intend to write about my opinions and thoughts about technology, especially AI. Important note: my opinions are not representative of my school or anyone I work with
* **Creative portfolio**
  * Aside from my primary work studying computer science, I am also very passionate about art!
  * For example, I look forward to sharing my creative works such as: oil paintings, 3D designs and prints, digital illustrations, and much more!
* **Usable code and detailed documentation**
  * While several of my projects have links to GitHub repositories, work still needs to be done on most to clean up the code and make them easier to use
  * I intend to work on more open-source projects that can actually be used and helpful to others!
